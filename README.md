# Snake-game
A classic Snake Game implemented in C++ with a focus on object-oriented design principles. This project features:

Game Mechanics: Controls a snake that grows as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.
User Interface: Provides a simple text-based interface with real-time game updates and score tracking.
Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes classes and objects to manage game entities such as the snake, food, and game board.
The project demonstrates core OOP concepts including encapsulation and abstraction, and offers an engaging way to understand game development fundamentals.
